# MatrixOrigin Talent Challenges



<img src="logo.png" width="400">

This repository contains coding challenges used for candidates who are willing to join MatrixOrigin. The aim for these challenges is to find out those who are willing to learn with strong persistence as well as engineering skills. It's only a naive proof and has nothing to do with what we are working on, please do not push your solutions publicly.
